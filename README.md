# mulib

`mulib` is curated collection of software modules written in pure C, written from the ground up specifically for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained environments.

mulib features:

* a fast and lithe run-to-completion (single-threaded) scheduler
* low-overhead timing and event handling
* advanced in-place string handling
* flexible logging
* a variety of other useful modules
* yours to use: The entirety of mulib is covered under the MIT open source license.
